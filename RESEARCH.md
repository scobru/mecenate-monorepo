Mecenate Feeds is a protocol that maintains a data marketplace.

## How does it work?

Mecenate is a protocol composed by a set of smart contracts that assicure the user's privacy and the integrity of the data. The protocol would to be open source and decentralized. All the fees are distributed to the Mecenate ID holders and protocols collaborators.

## What is being built?

There are currently one applications built on top of the Mecenate Feeds Protocol:

1. Mecenate Feeds Mecenate Feeds allows anyone to publish data and stake capital behind the accuracy of that information. Users can build a verifiable track record and stake their predictions with ETH. By staking ETH, the seller of a prediction puts value at risk if the prediction goes wrong. When a seller stakes behind their prediction they choose a "griefing factor". Griefing factor = degree (e.g. 1:10) to which the buyer is able to destroy their stake. If the seller stakes ETH, the buyer can destroy both their stakes for ETH .

2. Mecenate Bay is a marketplace build on top of Mecenate Feeds for sourcing ANY kind of information (secrets, predictions etc). Requests for information are matched with a stake by "fulfillers" who get paid if the information meets the set parameters. ETH is used for staking. Ethers from punished fulfillers are sent to the Mecenate treasury and distributed between users protocol.

3. Mecenate Vault is an anonymous WETH Pool that allow user to deposit their WETH and withdraw it with zkproof verificatoin.
