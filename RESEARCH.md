# Research

Mecenate Feeds is a protocol that maintains a data marketplace.

## How does it work?

Mecenate is a protocol composed by a set of smart contracts that assicure the user's privacy and the integrity of the data. The protocol would to be open source and decentralized. All the fees are distributed to the Mecenate ID holders and protocols collaborators.

## What is being built?

There are currently one applications built on top of the Mecenate Feeds Protocol:

1. Mecenate Feeds
Mecenate Feeds allows anyone to publish data and stake capital behind the accuracy of that information. Users can build a verifiable track record and stake their predictions with ETH. By staking ETH, the seller of a prediction puts value at risk if the prediction goes wrong.
When a seller stakes behind their prediction they choose a "griefing factor". Griefing factor = degree (e.g. 1:10) to which the buyer is able to destroy their stake. If the seller stakes ETH, the buyer can destroy both their stakes for ETH .

2. Mecenate Bay
is a marketplace build on top of Mecenate Feeds for sourcing ANY kind of information (secrets, predictions etc). Requests for information are matched with a stake by "fulfillers" who get paid if the information meets the set parameters. ETH is used for staking. Ethers from punished fulfillers are sent to the Mecenate treasury and distributed every 7 weeks to Mecenate ID holders.

3. Mecenate Question
is a prediction market for the Mecenate protocol. The protocol allow an user to become a trusted oracle and stake ETH behind their answer after a question is asked. The Other users can then bet on the answer. After the ending time of the question, the oracle can reveal the answer and the users can vote if the answer is correct or not. If the answer is correct, the oracle gets the betted ETH plus the collected fees, and the others get their ETH back plus a reward if they bet with the same answer of the oracle. If the answer is wrong, the oracle loses the betted ETH and the others get their ETH back plus a reward if they bet with the opposite answer of the oracle. The protocol is based on the Mecenate Feeds protocol.

4. Mecenate Identity
is a nft contract that allows users to create a unique identity on the Mecenate ecosystem. The protocol is based on the ERC721 standard and it is used to access the Mecenate Feeds protocol. The mint price of the ID increases with every new ID minted. This is to discourage the minting of false identities as all Mecenate ID holders can enjoy the profits of the protocol's distributions.

5. Mecenate Tier
is a contract that allows users to create a tier on the Mecenate ecosystem. You can create a tier for your ID and you can invite your friends to join your tier. With few line of code as a dev you can integrate the Mecenate Tier contract in your dapp or share exclusive content to your tier members.

6. Mecenate Box
Is an anonymous WETH Pool that allow user to lock their WETH and withdraw it after a certain time with a unique code.

## Governance

The Mecenate protocol an Open Source Project. I piani futuri sono di rendere il protocollo legato ad un token di governance controllato da una dao, ed inoltre utilizzare quest'ultimo come mezzo di pagamento per i servizi offerti dal protocollo stesso. Attualmente gli id fungono da token di governance, in attesa di un ERC20 futuro.

## Token model

Mecenate ID is a non-fungible token that is used to access the protocol. The cost of an ID increases with every new ID minted. This is to discourage the minting of false identities as all Mecenate ID holders can enjoy the profits of the protocol's distributions.

The Futures plans are to make the protocol linked to a governance token called MUSE controlled by a DAO, and also to use it as a means of payment for the services offered by the protocol itself. Currently the IDs function as governance tokens, pending a future ERC20.
