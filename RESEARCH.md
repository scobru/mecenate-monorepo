Mecenate Feeds is a protocol that maintains a data marketplace.

## How does it work?

Mecenate is a protocol composed by a set of smart contracts that assicure the user's privacy and the integrity of the data. The protocol would to be open source and decentralized. All the fees are distributed to the Mecenate ID holders and protocols collaborators.

## What is being built?

There are currently one applications built on top of the Mecenate Feeds Protocol:

1. Mecenate Feeds Mecenate Feeds allows anyone to publish data and stake capital behind the accuracy of that information. Users can build a verifiable track record and stake their predictions with ETH. By staking ETH, the seller of a prediction puts value at risk if the prediction goes wrong. When a seller stakes behind their prediction they choose a "griefing factor". Griefing factor = degree (e.g. 1:10) to which the buyer is able to destroy their stake. If the seller stakes ETH, the buyer can destroy both their stakes for ETH .
2. Mecenate Bay is a marketplace build on top of Mecenate Feeds for sourcing ANY kind of information (secrets, predictions etc). Requests for information are matched with a stake by "fulfillers" who get paid if the information meets the set parameters. ETH is used for staking. Ethers from punished fulfillers are sent to the Mecenate treasury and distributed every 7 weeks to Mecenate ID holders.
3. Mecenate VaultIs an anonymous WETH Pool that allow user to lock their WETH and withdraw it with zkproof authorization

## Governance

The Mecenate protocol an Open Source Project. I piani futuri sono di rendere il protocollo legato ad un token di governance controllato da una dao, ed inoltre utilizzare quest'ultimo come mezzo di pagamento per i servizi offerti dal protocollo stesso. Attualmente gli id fungono da token di governance, in attesa di un ERC20 futuro.

## Token model

Mecenate ID is a non-fungible token that is used to access the protocol. The cost of an ID increases with every new ID minted. This is to discourage the minting of false identities as all Mecenate ID holders can enjoy the profits of the protocol's distributions.

The Futures plans are to make the protocol linked to a governance token called MUSE controlled by a DAO, and also to use it as a means of payment for the services offered by the protocol itself. Currently the IDs function as governance tokens, pending a future ERC20.
