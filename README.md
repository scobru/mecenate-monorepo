This project is dedicated to anyone who wishes to exchange information and data anonymously, while also providing a system designed to filter and ensure the quality of the data received.

## What's New ?

## Update 26/10/2023 v2.0.0

We are thrilled to announce version 2 of Mecenate with the following enhancements:

### Smart Contract

- [x] **Multi-Token Usage**: Now supports ETH, DAI, and MUSE (the protocol token) as currencies for feeds.
- [x] **Security and Gas Fee Optimization**: Improved security measures and optimized gas fees for better performance.
- [x] **Mecenate EAS Resolver Contract**: Introduced the Mecenate EAS Resolver contract to ensure the attestations are genuinely valid.
- [x] **Attestation Mechanism**: Implemented an attestation mechanism via eas during the post finalization stage. When the Buyer confirms the data validity, they also attest to the seller's reliability on-chain.
- [x] **MUSE Token Burning Mechanism**: Implemented a mechanism for burning the native MUSE tokens to control the supply and increase scarcity.
- [x] **Uniswap Purchase and Burning**: Enabled the purchase of native MUSE tokens on Uniswap using DAI and ETH, followed by a burning mechanism to further manage the token economics.

### Frontend

- [x] **Account Abstraction and Social Login**: Implemented Account Abstraction and social login functionalities using Web3Auth.
- [x] **Sismo Implementation**: Integrated Sismo to verify user identity via zkproof without requiring the user to provide any data to the platform.
