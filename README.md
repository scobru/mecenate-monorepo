## üí° CONCEPT

---

### Introduction

I have created a protocol called Mecenate for the Buidlguidl hackathon. The protocol is inspired by the [Erasure Protocol](https://github.com/erasureprotocol/erasure-protocol), which is the backbone of the NMR token. Mecenate is a decentralized and anonymous data exchange protocol that is designed to improve upon the functions of the Erasure Protocol.

As a solo developer, this project was ambitious to undertake, and there is a possibility that the current version 1 deployed on the Polygon Mumbai network may have some bugs. I invite other developers who share a passion for decentralized data exchange to join this project and help it reach its full potential. Additionally, we welcome users to report any errors or bugs they may encounter in the protocol's contracts or frontend.

Mecenate Protocol allows for secure and private information sharing and is designed to improve upon the functions of the Erasure Protocol.

### Features

Mecenate consists of several applications, including:

- üìÑMecenate Feed: A smart contract protocol for sharing information privately and anonymously, similar to the Erasure Protocol clone.
- üì£Mecenate Bay: A Dapp marketplace built on top of Mecenate Feed.
- üÜîMecenate Identity: A Dapp for creating a tokenized identity.
- üé´Mecenate Tier: A Dapp for creating subscriptions and memberships.
- ‚ùîMecenate Question: A Dapp for prediction markets where users can act as both hosts and oracles.

## üöÄ QUICK START

---

To get started with Scaffold-Eth 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/scobru/mecenate-monorepo.git
    cd mecenate-monorepo
    yarn
    ```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

    ```bash
    yarn chain
    ```

3. This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in packages/hardhat/contracts and can be modified to suit your needs. The yarn deploy command uses the deploy script located in packages/hardhat/deploy to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

### Development Notes

The folder structure:

```bash
client  ts-node cli
nextjs  nextjs app     
hardhat hardhat app        
```

The Mecenate repository is composed of ScaffoldEth-2 and another application called "client", which allows interaction with the protocol through a command-line interface written in TypeScript.

### Treasury & DAO

Mecenate possesses a treasury that collects the fees accumulated from the use of the protocol's contracts. The plan is to create a treasury controlled by a DAO, which is aimed at making the protocol completely decentralized.

### Contribution

Other developers who share a passion for decentralized data exchange are invited to join this project and help it reach its full potential.

Thank you for taking the time to read about Mecenate, and we look forward to sharing more updates soon.
