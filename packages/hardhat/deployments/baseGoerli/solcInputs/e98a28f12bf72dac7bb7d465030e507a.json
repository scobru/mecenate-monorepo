If the post has an escrow payment, it checks if the buyer has paid enough and adds the payment to the post's escrow. If the post does not have an escrow payment, it requires a payment from the buyer and adds it to the post's escrow. Finally, it changes the post status to Accepted and emits an Accepted event.\n */\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity 0.8.19;\n\nimport \"./Events.sol\";\nimport \"./Staking.sol\";\n\nabstract contract Acceptance is Events, Staking {\n    function acceptPost(\n        bytes memory sismoConnectResponse,\n        address _to,\n        bytes32 _nonce,\n        Structures.Tokens tokenId,\n        uint256 _paymentAmount\n    ) external payable virtual {\n        require(\n            validStatuses[uint8(Structures.PostStatus.Proposed)],\n            \"INVALID_STATUS\"\n        );\n\n        _checkToken(tokenId);\n\n        uint256 amountToAdd = tokenId == Structures.Tokens.NaN\n            ? msg.value\n            : _paymentAmount;\n        bytes32 sellerVaultIdHash = keccak256(postSettingPrivate.vaultIdSeller);\n\n        // Get encryptedVaultId only once\n        (\n            bytes memory vaultId,\n            uint256 twitterId,\n            uint256 telegramId,\n\n        ) = _verifyNonce(sismoConnectResponse, _to, _nonce);\n        bytes32 encryptedVaultId = keccak256(vaultId);\n\n        // Use local variable for repeated calls\n        uint256 sellerStake = Deposit._getDeposit(tokenId, sellerVaultIdHash);\n\n        require(sellerStake >= post.postdata.escrow.stake, \"STAKE_INCORRECT\");\n        require(\n            IMecenateUsers(settings.usersModuleContract).checkifUserExist(\n                encryptedVaultId\n            ),\n            \"USERT_NOT_EXIST\"\n        );\n        require(encryptedVaultId != sellerVaultIdHash, \"YOU_ARE_THE_SELLER\");\n\n        if (post.postdata.escrow.payment > 0) {\n            require(\n                _paymentAmount >= post.postdata.escrow.payment,\n                \"NOT_ENOUGH_PAYMENT\"\n            );\n        } else {\n            require(msg.value > 0, \"ZERO_MSGVALUE\");\n            require(_paymentAmount > 0, \"ZERO_PAYMENT\");\n        }\n\n        uint256 payment = _addStake(\n            tokenId,\n            encryptedVaultId,\n            settings.vaultContract,\n            amountToAdd\n        );\n\n        // Update all at once\n        post.postdata.escrow.payment = payment;\n        post.postdata.settings.status = Structures.PostStatus.Accepted;\n        _changeStatus(Structures.PostStatus.Accepted);\n\n        // Update private settings\n        postSettingPrivate.vaultIdBuyer = vaultId;\n        postSettingPrivate.buyerTwitterId = twitterId;\n        postSettingPrivate.buyerTelegramId = telegramId;\n\n        emit Accepted(post);\n    }\n}\n"
