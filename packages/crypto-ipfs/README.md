# Mecenate Crypto + IPFS Helpers

For asymmetric crypto we use the [TweetNaCL.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js) library.

For symmetric crypto we use the [Fernet.js](https://github.com/csquared/fernet.js) library. Please note that this implementation of fernet has not been audited.

See tests for usage examples.
